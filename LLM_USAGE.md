# LLM Usage Summary

This project used Large Language Models (LLMs) as an auxiliary tool to support development.
LLMs were primarily involved in improving the implementation of built-in list functions, enhancing code clarity, and assisting with debugging.

## 1. Parser
LLMs helped with refactoring code of lambda, recursive lambda and function application to be able to use it with multiple arguments.

## 2. Interpreter Implementation
LLMs assisted in implementing predefined functions for lists (map, fold, mapfold and filter).

## 3. Testing
LLMs helped with automatization of tests (functions of printing, assertEqualValue and assertions itself). The automatizations were based on written tests and enriched it with tests using lists.

## 4. Documentation
LLMs contributed to structuring cores of documentation files to improve readability.

## 5. Role of using LLMs
It is important to note that LLMs served strictly as an assistant, not as a replacement for actual architecture/implementation work. Most of the help was used during the later stages of the project, primarily for code refinement, debugging, and extending list-related functionality.

All the ideas and code fragments generated by LLMs and incorporated into the final implementation were explicitly reviewed, tested, and adjusted by me. I take full responsibility for the design and correctness of the resulting system.
